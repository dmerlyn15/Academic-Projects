I selected a dataset from the meteorological department at the HI-SEAS weather station from the year 2016. 
In this project, I worked on a model to help predict the level of Solar Radiation based on the historical data provided. 
With the help of accurate solar radiation level prediction, one would be able to discern if solar batteries could be used in the future. 
Also, for high renewable energy generation, businesses could consider installing Solar Panels effectively in the months when solar radiation is at its maximum.
